              <p>The game's plot is set in a fictional history of real-world events and follows the millennia-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight to preserve peace and free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. The framing story is set in the 21st century and follows Desmond Miles as he relives the genetic memories of his ancestor, Ezio Auditore da Firenze, to uncover the mysteries left behind by an ancient race known as the First Civilization in the hope of ending the Assassin-Templar conflict. The main narrative takes place at the height of the Renaissance in Italy from 1476 to 1499, and follows Ezio's journey as an Assassin while seeking revenge against those responsible for the death of his father and brothers. Gameplay focuses on using Ezio's combat, stealth, and parkour abilities to defeat enemies and explore the environment. The game features a large open world comprising several Italian cities, including Florence, Venice, Monteriggioni, San Gimignano, and Forlì, all of which have been accurately recreated to fit the game's historical setting.</p>

              <h3>Dota 2</h3>
              <p>Dota 2 is a 2013 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game by Valve. The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character known as a "hero" that all have unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match players collect experience points and items for their heroes to defeat the opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat. A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team's "Ancient", a large structure located within their base.</p>

              <p>The game is the first game in the new EA Sports FC series, developed by EA Vancouver and EA Romania, following the conclusion of EA's partnership with FIFA. Launched on 29 September 2023 for multiple platforms including Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Windows, and Xbox, this 31st installment of EA's football series features enhanced realism and gameplay. The Ultimate Edition's cover art, reminiscent of the iconic Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album, showcases 31 football legends, though it drew mixed reactions for the accuracy of player likenesses. The game introduces HyperMotion V technology, providing lifelike player movements and AcceleRATE 2.0 for more nuanced player acceleration. New features include PlayStyles, optimizing players' in-game abilities, and an upgraded Ultimate Team mode with Evolutions and the inclusion of both male and female players. Additionally, the game expands cross-platform play options and brings significant updates to the Nintendo Switch version, utilizing the Frostbite engine for improved gameplay, although lacking some features like HyperMotion technology</p>
